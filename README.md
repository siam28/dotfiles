All Dem Dots
============

This is mostly for my own benefit but feel free to use whatever you like~


Awesome WM Stuff
----------------

the theme called 'default' in my [.config/awesome/themes/](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/awesome/themes/default) is not the actual default theme, but one that matches the [Jellybeans Vim theme](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim "jellybeans.vim")


Xresources
----------

Colors from: https://github.com/w0ng/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/termcolours/jellybeans


Conky
-----

Here's what [my conky config](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/blob/master/.conkyrc) looks like. I don't use conky anymore but I like how this one looks so I'll keep ot around. Based on Archey.


Vim
---

All the plugins I use are listed at the top of [my vimrc](https://github.com/zezhyrule/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc). A great theme to check out is [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme "Tomorrow Theme").
Yes, my vimrc is super ugly. I will clean it one day.


Misc
----

[Dina Font](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/dina-font/) is my go-to font for all my monospace needs, if anyone is wondering. It's a great font, I recommend it to everyone! It's in the Arch community repo.
